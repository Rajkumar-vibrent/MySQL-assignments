Description: 
- We have multiple students learning at an academy.
- Each student should be uniquely identifiable
- The academy offers multiple courses.
- A student can take any number of courses
- A student obtains a score for each subject when finishes the course. This is
  captured along with the date and time he completed the course.
- A student can repeat the same course multiple number of times and thus earns
  multiple scores for the same course as well.
